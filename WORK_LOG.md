| Sep 25  | 1:00pm-1:45pm | I began thinking about the problem like Lucas said in the class. I tried to associate distinct numbers to each word in the dictionary. I figured I'd need a helper function for that so I just started by making a method that would convert characters to ascii values and multiply to make a likely unique value. In my main function, I called the function on each word in the dictionary. |
