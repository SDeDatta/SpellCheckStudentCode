| Sep 25  |  1:00pm-1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I began thinking about the problem like Lucas said in the class. I tried to associate distinct numbers to each word in the dictionary. I figured I'd need a helper function for that so I just started by making a method that would convert characters to ascii values and multiply to make a likely unique value. In my main function, I called the function on each word in the dictionary. |
| Sep 27  |  8:00pm-8:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I continued the plan I created on Thursday and called the helper function on every word in text as well. I then began to think about how I'd compare the two integer arrays. I learned a little about hash sets through research but figured I should stick with arrays and array lists until I get working code. So, I started to write code to compare the two integer arrays but realized I needed some sort of boolean array to keep track of the comparisons. |
| Sep 28  |  4:30pm-5:20pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I continued coding the comparison to ensure each string in text has a matching one in dictionary through integers. With the boolean array, I then converted back to Strings for the words that didn't find matches and returned that. My code passed one of the test but struggled with bigger cases and took long amounts of time. So, I considered if my helper function wasn't actually creating distinct values for each word and also considered sorting the integers. I began to rethink whether or not I was making distinct values and whether there was an overflow causing the immense time to complete a test. |
| Sep 29  | 11:00pm-11:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I decided to focus on whether or not I'm creating a unique value for each word in the dictionary because that would be a bigger flaw. I thought of the example of "cat" and "act." These two words would have the same value with my current formula and I rethought the difference between the two. I realized I needed to use the place value of each character to differentiate the two so I began toying around with multiplying, dividing, and other functions with i since the for loop technically goes through each place value. |

I struggled to find any working solutions so moved onto making sure my main function was error free and made it more code fluent by removing some else statements. I returned to the computeNum function and realized my code was only working properly for characters in the alphabet since I was subtracting by the ascii value of a. So, I removed that part of my code even though it would still function without it because the a value was just a bit arbitrary than. I originally used it to make the finalNums more compact. My changes to the computeNum function got me closer to the solutions for each test yet still didn't reach them. |
| Oct 4   |  7:00pm-8:30pm  | I reviewed the psuedocode for building a Trie based solution that we discussed in class. I started implementing the insert function by looking at each child of a given root node to see if they match the letter of my word. I was in the process of writing a second for loop when I considered if I could get an index of some sort and simply see if the children array at the given index for the next letter in my word is empty or not. If it's not empty, I could keep following the word down, otherwise I could make a new node with the letter I'm on and make the isWord of final node true after the for loop. I used ascii value subtraction as my index since everything in the dictionary is a letter. I then began the search function and used a similar approach and completed it pretty quickly. I then returned to my main function and made a trie in which I filled all the words from the dictionary and checked to see if all the words from the text are present in the dictionary. I got to the point where I need to converted my Trie for misspelled words into a String array and am a bit stuck there. |
| Oct 6   |  8:45pm-9:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I approached the trie to array issue recursively because I found it to be a naturally recursive issue. If you need to "follow" a chain down it feels much more natural to use recursive code. I began to code it in one function but struggled with the base case because I needed to return something. I then wrote out a helper function and got stuck at the recursive step before realizing I could convert back and forth betweeen ints and chars to get the next char to follow while keeping a 0-26 index. I then ran the code and got some index out of bounds errors and remembered apostrophes need to be part of a word and could throw off my current 0-26 index scale since subtracting the ascii value of a doesn't land in that range. I began thinking of some potential solutions such as dedicated a 27th spot in each letter array for apostrophes. |
| Oct 7   | 12:45pm-1:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                          Mr. Blick enlightened us about trying to save space for our trie as a bad idea. So, I implemented extended ascii for the length of each array attached to a node instead of trying to fit everything into a range of 0-26. After doing that, I stopped getting index out of bounds errors so I therefore knew my misspelled trie to array method was simply not working properly instead of any errors. So, reviewed my main method in SpellCheck and considered whether my trie to array function was returning words in the same order as the text. I realized that my function was not returning in order so I considered different ways of converting my trie to an array without an extra method. I looked at where I added to my misspelled trie and realized I could make a list of the words I add to the misspelled trie which would keep the order of the words proper. It worked smoothly and I got to get rid of all the extra code I had prior. |
