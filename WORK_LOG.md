| April 5 |     9-10pm      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Sep 25  |  1:00pm-1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I began thinking about the problem like Lucas said in the class. I tried to associate distinct numbers to each word in the dictionary. I figured I'd need a helper function for that so I just started by making a method that would convert characters to ascii values and multiply to make a likely unique value. In my main function, I called the function on each word in the dictionary. |
| Sep 27  |  8:00pm-8:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I continued the plan I created on Thursday and called the helper function on every word in text as well. I then began to think about how I'd compare the two integer arrays. I learned a little about hash sets through research but figured I should stick with arrays and array lists until I get working code. So, I started to write code to compare the two integer arrays but realized I needed some sort of boolean array to keep track of the comparisons. |
| Sep 28  |  4:30pm-5:20pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                     I continued coding the comparison to ensure each string in text has a matching one in dictionary through integers. With the boolean array, I then converted back to Strings for the words that didn't find matches and returned that. My code passed one of the test but struggled with bigger cases and took long amounts of time. So, I considered if my helper function wasn't actually creating distinct values for each word and also considered sorting the integers. I began to rethink whether or not I was making distinct values and whether there was an overflow causing the immense time to complete a test. |
| Sep 29  | 11:00pm-11:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I decided to focus on whether or not I'm creating a unique value for each word in the dictionary because that would be a bigger flaw. I thought of the example of "cat" and "act." These two words would have the same value with my current formula and I rethought the difference between the two. I realized I needed to use the place value of each character to differentiate the two so I began toying around with multiplying, dividing, and other functions with i since the for loop technically goes through each place value. |
| Sep 30  |  9:00pm-9:45pm  | I experimented with a bunch of different ways to manipulate i in my computeNum function to see if I could get distinct numbers for each and every word. I struggled to find any working solutions so moved onto making sure my main function was error free and made it more code fluent by removing some else statements. I returned to the computeNum function and realized my code was only working properly for characters in the alphabet since I was subtracting by the ascii value of a. So, I removed that part of my code even though it would still function without it because the a value was just a bit arbitrary than. I originally used it to make the finalNums more compact. My changes to the computeNum function got me closer to the solutions for each test yet still didn't reach them. |
