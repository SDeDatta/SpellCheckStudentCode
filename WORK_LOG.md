| April 5 |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Sep 25  | 1:00pm-1:45pm |                                                                                                                                                                                          I began thinking about the problem like Lucas said in the class. I tried to associate distinct numbers to each word in the dictionary. I figured I'd need a helper function for that so I just started by making a method that would convert characters to ascii values and multiply to make a likely unique value. In my main function, I called the function on each word in the dictionary. |
| Sep 27  | 8:00pm-8:30pm |                                                                                                                      I continued the plan I created on Thursday and called the helper function on every word in text as well. I then began to think about how I'd compare the two integer arrays. I learned a little about hash sets through research but figured I should stick with arrays and array lists until I get working code. So, I started to write code to compare the two integer arrays but realized I needed some sort of boolean array to keep track of the comparisons. |
| Sep 28  | 4:30pm-5:15pm | I continued coding the comparison to ensure each string in text has a matching one in dictionary through integers. With the boolean array, I then converted back to Strings for the words that didn't find matches and returned that. My code passed one of the test but struggled with bigger cases and took long amounts of time. So, I considered if my helper function wasn't actually creating distinct values for each word and also considered sorting the integers. I began to think of ways I could sort the integers to try to maximize efficiency for my semi-working code.  |
